### G'day traveller.  Thanks for stopping by 👋

I'm slowly assembling a library of projects for Computer Science teachers to use with their high school students and/or beginning college students.  Everything here is free for your classroom use.  All I ask is that you contribute back to the library and when the opportunity arises, put in a kind word.

What I do? 👨‍💻
* Computer Science Instructor
* Math Instructor
* Tutor

What if you like my work? 🤩
* You can Star ⭐ the repositories you like.
* You can tell other teachers
* You can contribute your own project

<!--
**ke5urh/ke5urh** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
