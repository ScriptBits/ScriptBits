### G'day traveller.  Thanks for stopping by 👋

I am assembling this library of projects for Computer Science teachers to use with their high school students and/or beginning college students.  These are projects that have worked well in my classrooms over the last few years.  Everything here is free for your classroom use.  All I ask is that you contribute back to the library and when the opportunity arises, put in a kind word for what I'm trying to do.

There are certainly better-made games out there. The goal here is to introduce teenage students to the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming in an age-appropriate manner.  There are a plethora of resources for primary school childrean (think "Scratch").  For the more advanced students in college and beyond, again there is a multitude of great resources.  But, for our secondary students in grades 10 thru 12, we lack activities and resources to help students:  A) enjoy what they are doing; B) understand fundamental programming constructs (If-Statements, For-Loops); and C) understand classes and objects.  

If the games are too complex, the programming will crush them.  If the game is too simple, then our game-savy teens quickly lose motivation.  It's the Goldilocks Prinicple.

Please remember that most of our teens are running away from the hard sciences because it makes their heads hurt.  Most haven't develped the academic skills and motivation to wrestle a problem to the ground.  So, we need to get busy creating interesting, age-appropriate programming projects that meet our teens where they live.  If you are so inclined to help, then take a look at what I am starting with and feel free to collaborate.  Again, thanks for stopping by!  Best wishes, Doug
