### G'day traveller.  Thanks for stopping by 👋

I am assembling this library of projects for Computer Science teachers to use with their high school students and/or beginning college students.  These are projects that have worked well in my classrooms over the last few years.  Everything here is free for your classroom use.  All I ask is that you contribute back to the library and when the opportunity arises, put in a kind word for what I'm trying to do.

There are certainly better-made games out there. The goal here is to introduce teenage students to the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming in an age-appropriate manner.  There are a plethora of resources for Primary School childrean (think "Scratch").  For the more advanced students in college and beyond, again there is a multitude of great resources.  But, for our Secondary students in grades 10 thru 12, we lack activities and resources to help students:  A) enjoy what they are doing; B) understand fundamental programming constructs (If-Statement, For-Loop); and C) understand classes and objects.  In addtion, there are a multitude of broken flash games on the internet that deceive the average politician into believing that resources abound for this age-group. (sigh)

So, we need to get busy creating interesting, age-appropriate programming projects that meet our teens where they live.  If you are so inclined to help, then take a look at what I am starting with and feel free to collaborate.  Gain, thanks for stopping by!  Best wishes, Doug
