### G'day traveller.  Thanks for stopping by 👋

I'm slowly assembling a library of projects for Computer Science teachers to use with their high school students and/or beginning college students.  These are projects that have worked well in my classrooms over the last few years.  Of course, each project individually might be in a state of repair or upgrade.  If in doubt, ask me.

Everything here is free for your classroom use.  All I ask is that you contribute back to the library and when the opportunity arises, put in a kind word for what I'm trying to do.

What I do? 👨‍💻
* Computer Science Instructor
* Mathematics Instructor
* Free tutor to anyone who wants to learn

What if you like my work? 🤩
* You can Star ⭐ the repositories you like.
* You can click the follow button and tell other teachers
* You can contribute your own projects to this library
