### G'day traveller.  Thanks for stopping by 👋

I am currently working to create projects for Computer Science teachers to use with their high school students and/or beginning college students.  (Some projects are under construction...careful the potholes.)

What I do? 👨‍💻

Questions you may have.  😕
* Who are you?
  * Husband & Father
* Why do you teach school?
  * This is the best way for me to serve my country
  * Can't take money with me to heaven
